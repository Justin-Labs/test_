git inti on command line to make folder a git repository

git status on command line gives an summary of git repository

git add "file name"

git commit -m "added readme.txt"

"new line here, saved file. then putting in git status in terminal
gives no changes staged for commit"

git add

or 

"git add ."  #adds everything to be staged for commit.

"git status" will now show it is staged for commit. 

followed by of course, git commit -m "made changes to Read me.txt"

Now lets say we want to start a new branch...
"git checkout -b new"

new branch

git add .
git commit -m "first comment on new branch"

to change branches type git checkout name_of_branch
so..
git checkout main

how do we update a branch with the master/ main branch..
git merge master

if we want to change our origin
git remote set-url origin "https://github.com/....our directory...."
